# Gulp Community Logo
![Gulp Community Logo](./source.inkscape.svg)

## Meaning
The community logo is a beer mug. This image was chosen because beer thingy usually drunk when people get together in a pub. Which is a community in somewhat meaning it could offer, getting together. Another reason for a glass of beer is to inherit the original Gulp logo, a drinking cup. And finally, coding can be as addictive as drinking alcohol.
